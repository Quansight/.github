## Code of Conduct

All participants in Quansight repositories on GitHub are expected to follow
the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

All repos in the Quansight organization will automatically link to this code
of conduct, for example, in text in new issue forms. If you want, you may also
copy `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` directly to the repo, so that it is more visible.
